00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,994


You really don't remember


what happened last year?


00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,920
- School. Now.
- I dropped out.

00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,510
- Get your diploma, I'll get mine.
- What you doing?

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,514
- Studying.
- You taking your GED? All right, Fi.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,716
Estefania, Fiona.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,599
You married a drug lord's daughter?

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,274
I'm not in love with her.

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,433
She doesn't love you either.
She's got this other guy Marco.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,717
Marco, you're me now, take my identity.

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,156
If Este's dad comes looking,
she'll be married.

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,993
We can't have sex anymore.

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,676
- I'm pretty sure that Jody's gonna propose.
- You're better than this guy.

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,078
Stay the fuck away from me
and stay the fuck away from this baby.

200
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,438
Is it all right if I stay over tonight?

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,711
Couldn't go 12 hours without seeing me?

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,396
Went to the clinic today,
said me having kids, not likely.

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,434
- No one said we have to stop trying.
- Hello, boys.

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,672
- We got nothing to be ashamed of.
- Fucking world do you live in?

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,354
Officer.

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,713
- Get on the ground.
- This violating my probation? Heh, heh.

21
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,439
Unh!

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,991
- Is it the baby?
- No. It's you. Get out!

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,557
I really am so sorry about all of this
with Karen.

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,154
You deserve better.

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,551
Congratulations, my boy.
You hit the jackpot.

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,915
- Frank.
- What?

27
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,116
I think you should go.

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,556
Why don't you just live at your real home
with your real family?

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,796
I don't like them.

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,076
And they don't like me.

31
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,914
Hey, stop that! Hey!

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,275
Please just go. Leave.

33
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,717
- Mind if I sleep here for the night?
- It's no problem for me.

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,236
- Legal resident here, Steve?
- Name's Jimmy now.

35
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,114
"Steve" was an alias he used
to lie about who he was.

36
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,476
- I wanna meet your family.
- Sorry to be late.

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,838
These are Fiona's brothers, Carl and Ian.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,275
Do they know you're gay?

39
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,193
- I'm not gay.
- Really?

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,273
- It's coming. It's coming.
- Whoo!

41
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,909
- Doctor.
- What's wrong with him?

42
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,589
- He has Down syndrome, Debs.
- Yeah, and he's Asian.

43
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,275
Take it back to the hospital,
somebody will want it.

44
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,669
I want it.

45
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,916
It's me or the baby.

46
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,275
The baby, sweetheart.

47
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,636
You know, you're gonna regret this.

48
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,230
I love you.

49
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,357
- Are you gonna leave?
- No.

50
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,874
Everybody always leaves.

51
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,999
I won't.

52
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,315
Ugh.

53
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,236
- Morning, sunshine.
- Why didn't you wake me up?

54
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,154
- I gotta make lunches before work.
- Already done.

55
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,915
Carl, my man,
would you like some more French toast?

56
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,833
- Uh-huh.
- Lip and Ian?

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,957
Already fed and gone.

58
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,237
Why are you eating a Popsicle
for breakfast?

59
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,675
Jimmy said it was okay.

60
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,790
- Got your smoothie ready to go.
- Where's Debbie?

61
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,153
Out front like always.

62
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,240
Morning, Debs.

63
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,199
One hundred and thirty-seven days.

64
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,072
When I was 9 he was gone for a year.

65
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,630
He always comes back.

66
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,039
Lunch.

67
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,511
He'll be back, Debs.

68
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,350
He always comes back.

69
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,836
Hey, <i>señor.</i>

70
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,915
Hey.

71
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,670
Hey.

72
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,838
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

73
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,830
Hey, help me.

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,116
You need help?

75
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,040
Yes, thank you. Where am I?

76
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,590
- Juarez.
- Mexico?

77
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,595
Did I miss Christmas?

78
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,434
Christmas?
You almost missed Easter.

79
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,031
There's an Escalade parked
across the street with someone in it.

80
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,953
It's nice. Still has its hubcaps.
I think it was there yesterday too.

81
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,875
- Popsicle for breakfast?
- Carl's teeth hurt.

82
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,158
Yeah, because he's eating Popsicles
for breakfast. Did he brush?

83
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,959
- Before he left?
- Yeah, think so.

84
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,954
Did you check his toothbrush,
see if it was wet?

85
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:30,512
Hm. I was hoping that you'd still be in bed
when the kids left for school.

86
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,830
I have to work.

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,390
- You've got five minutes.
- Five?

88
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,200
Make it 10 if I focus on White Sox scores
or something.

89
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,234
Liam?

90
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,552
Just plop him down in front
of <i>The Wiggles</i>, he's good for hours.

91
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,153
I can't be late. I can't be late,
I need the cash for the property tax bill.

92
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,394
Don't tell my kids they can do things
they know they can't.

93
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,273
- Your kids?
- A Popsicle?

94
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,238
So I'm just the nanny?

95
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,758
I can feed them, change them,
but when Carl wants a second Popsicle--

96
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,912
- Second?
- Didn't like the first. Banana.

97
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,151
His teeth are going to rot out of his head.

98
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,829
- We just spent two grand on his braces.
- We?

99
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,074
What?

100
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,640
Not "we," me.
I paid for Carl's braces.

101
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,591
No more Popsicles for breakfast, okay?

102
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,594
Lip and Ian left early?

103
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,996
Said they had to pick something up
downtown.

104
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,072
- Downtown?
- What they said.

105
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,594
Pick up what?

106
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,752
Go, go, go!

107
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,272
When you said you had access,
I thought you meant through a door.

108
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,075
I may have fudged on that a bit.

109
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,152
- Hey!
- Come on.

110
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,311
Get out of the way, get out of the way.

111
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,794
Kid, stop. Out of the way.
Stop it!

112
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,795
Watch it!

113
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,194
Jesus, whatever happened to fat, donut-
eating cops? Now they're all Triathletes.

114
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,600
Catch.

115
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,195
Tall prick looks good
for another ten miles.

116
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,080
Shit.

117
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,513
Ditch it out at the street, yeah?

118
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,712
Wait, wait, wait, maybe they'll give up.

119
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,830
What are you doing?

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,071
Shit. Shit.

121
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,480
Whoa, whoa.

122
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,791
Right there, hold it!

123
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,998
No way West Point takes you
with a felony conviction.

124
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,873
Hey.

125
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,234
- Catch you at the courthouse later?
- Don't be stupid.

126
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,152
Call Mandy, all right?

127
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,433
Milkoviches gotta have
a good bail-bondsman.

128
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,797
Argh!

129
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,317
Baby.

130
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,959
Baby.

131
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,833
It's your turn.

132
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,592
I know you're awake,
you're making that fakey sleep sound.

133
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,678
I was up at 3 and 5.

134
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,992
Get your ass up, you goddamn, pony-tailed,
Fabio motherfucker!

135
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,950
What?

136
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,750
Get your goddamn ass out of this bed!
It's your fucking turn!

137
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,435
Is someone tearing his flesh off?

138
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,672
We sure this Ferber dude knows
what the hell he's talking about?

139
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,559
Go!

140
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,400
<i>Hush little baby don't say a word</i>

141
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,554
<i>Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird</i>

142
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,310
Stop it!

143
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,316
Passport, please.

144
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,318
Come on, man. Where's he going?

145
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,678
Medical emergency.

146
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,115
Hey, why's he going?

147
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,158
- Morning.
- Passport?

148
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,073
Uh, yeah. Uh....

149
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,434
No. Must have left them in my other pants.

150
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,957
But I'm an American citizen.
Chi Town born and raised.

151
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,440
No passport, no entry.

152
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,273
What? Since when?

153
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,353
Since Al Qaeda decided
Americans needed killing.

154
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,911
You see, here's the thing, Agent Tacker.

155
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,750
You look like a man who occasionally
enjoys a malt beverage...

156
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,000
...so you can understand, every once in a
while a couple drinks can get out of hand.

157
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,200
But when it happens, next morning you
have to pick yourself up, dust yourself off...

158
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,832
...and get right back on the horse.
Am I right, or am I right? Just let me cross.

159
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,834
I won't tell anyone, I promise.

160
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,037
You got a driver's license?

161
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,351
Any form of photo ID?

162
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,636
Costco card?

163
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,951
Do I look like I've got a Costco card?

164
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,397
You look like you need a course
of penicillin and a lice comb.

165
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,112
Call home, get somebody to send you
some kind of photo ID...

166
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,313
...so we can use it to make you
a temporary passport.

167
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,550
Get cleaned up.

168
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,634
Not letting you into this country so you
can add to Texas' homeless population.

169
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,473
Next.

170
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,911
<i>He just walks in.
Doesn't even bother to knock.</i>

171
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,120
That's nothing, Kev waltzes in, does his
sit-down business while I'm taking a bath.

172
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,192
Only one bathroom, had to go.

173
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,240
We have another bathroom, but Jimmy
can't be bothered to go downstairs?

174
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,960
Kev once did his poopy business
while I was brushing.

175
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,276
Only one bathroom.

176
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,397
- Can I steal some of this?
- Sure.

177
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,553
Yesterday I caught him vacuuming
and watching Rachael Ray.

178
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,390
- Kev doesn't even know what a vacuum is.
- Sure I do, outer space.

179
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,595
Dude in <i>Armageddon</i> got sucked
right out of his space suit, exploded.

180
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,910
Nice overalls.

181
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,790
$14.50 an hour. You haven't lived
till you've vacuumed up toxic waste.

182
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,191
Hey, what do you think, am I camera ready
or what?

183
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,550
Ow!

184
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,237
My man. My topless web traffic
is way down, too many girls ironing.

185
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,713
We're going to have a kid, I need to save for
when my tits are the size of watermelons.

186
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,554
Probably a market for pervs
who wanna see a woman nursing.

187
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,280
Kev's worried our kid
might find these online one day.

188
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,909
Ooh. Shit on the net never goes away.

189
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,120
Kev junior's gonna be surfing for porn,
see his momma's big titties and get hungry.

190
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,078
So we're trying a new web thing.

191
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,756
Couple act. Master and slave. Wah.

192
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,116
- In a cast?
- Hey, man's got to eat.

193
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,840
- That's so wrong.
- It's educational.

194
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,516
By acting out a scene from the old
plantation, we're providing content...

195
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,919
...for an internet audience that embraces
a truthful reenactment of our past.

196
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,594
It's racist and wrong.

197
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,071
Which is why it's gonna make money
because this country is racist.

198
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,509
What's that about?

199
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,519
Place we were working yesterday
had a couple billion fleas.

200
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,794
Jimmy doesn't really do anything, he just
hangs around the house all day with Liam...

201
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,118
...making smoothies,
acting like he's the kids' new dad.

202
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,957
So he's vacuuming, cooking and changing
dirty diapers and you're still pissed?

203
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,477
Thought that's what you ladies wanted,
shared housework, wage equality.

204
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,957
All that <i>Hunger Games,</i> Lady Gaga,
girl-power shit?

205
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,511
We say it, but we don't mean it.
Nothing sexy about a man with a mop.

206
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,956
<i>I know a way to make it fun.</i>

207
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,112
<i>- What's that?
- Guess.</i>

208
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,112
<i>I don't know, tell us!</i>

209
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,312
<i>- At least give us a hint!
- Okay.</i>

210
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,630
Hey, my man.

211
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,036
<i>Huh?</i>

212
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,632
<i>I know, by singing words, it will be fun.</i>

213
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,790
My man.

214
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,719
<i>That's right, Sid, you guessed it.</i>

215
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,550
Living with someone's hard. Last time you
were with a guy longer than weeks?

216
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,995
- Pssh. Never.
- Wha--?

217
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,391
How long you been living with Jimmy,
three months?

218
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,076
- Four.
- Boring happens. We all get bored. It'll pass.

219
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,000
He'll stop being boring again soon.

220
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,071
Well, hello, Steve.

221
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,720
Nando.

222
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,639
Where is she, Steve?

223
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,516
Where's who?

224
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,272
Estefania, Steve.

225
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,920
My daughter.

226
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,515
- Your wife.
- Ah.

227
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,839
- What are we doing today?
- Biohazard.

228
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,640
Listen up. Sewer main backed up.

229
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,793
Sent effluent geysering
out their basement toilet.

230
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,111
Got a few blocks of raw sewage
down there.

231
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,636
Better grab the waders.

232
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,312
Bullshit! Bullshit!
It's fucking bullshit!

233
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,359
Motherfucking asshole son of a bitch...!

234
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,037
Phillip Ronan Gallagher.

235
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,513
Breaking and entering, grand theft,
assaulting two law enforcement officers.

236
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,512
Campus security, Your Honor.

237
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,713
Can rent-a-cops really be counted
as law enforcement officers?

238
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,669
- It's been, what, a couple of months?
- Almost a year, Your Honor.

239
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,595
- Turn a new leaf or just dumb luck?
- Walking the straight and narrow.

240
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,674
Thanks to the wise counsel and guidance
previously provided by this court.

241
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,878
- Are you mocking me, Phillip?
- No, Your Honor, absolutely not.

242
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,557
You know, I've nothing but respect for this
court and for the rule of law it represents.

243
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,680
You know, the rights we derive from over
900 years of fealty to the Magna Carta...

244
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,392
...are the only thing standing between us
and the anarchy of mob rule.

245
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,517
Hm. Still a minor, what a shame.

246
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,355
The defendant before you beat a co-worker
to death with a nail-studded 2x4...

247
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,911
...for finishing the coffee
and not starting a new pot.

248
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,518
You show up in this court again as an adult,
I'll make sure he's your cell mate.

249
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,760
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

250
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,999
Set a date for prelim.
Five hundred dollars bond.

251
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,039
<i>Please say, "Collect."
Calling card third number or enter your--</i>

252
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,954
- Collect.
<i>- Please say your name.</i>

253
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,238
- Frank.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

254
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,915
Ugh.

255
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,590
What's it mean when there's a plus sign?

256
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,910
International call.

257
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,630
Probably some Nigerian calling to tell you
you won a million bucks.

258
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,990
Ugh!

259
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,633
Daddy.

260
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,960
Daddy?

261
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,874
Daddy.

262
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,673
Frank?

263
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,040
Daddy.

264
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,398
Frank.

265
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,069
Ugh.

266
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,999
He's not here.

267
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,958
No cookies.

268
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,950
Jimmy didn't make any cookies.

269
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,480
Yeah, that's good, perfect.

270
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,951
Estefania and I spend time
helping a friend look after her siblings.

271
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,396
Tragic story really, mom's gone,
dad's a drunk--

272
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,552
- Out.
- It's okay. Thank you.

273
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,990
Whoa. Hey. How you--? Whoa, whoa, whoa.

274
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,595
Ah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Got you.

275
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,720
If he tries to run, shoot him.

276
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,869
You know, I was surprised
to see you in the States.

277
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,635
I thought that the DEA
had you on a watch list.

278
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,950
They do.

279
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,672
So you can imagine how happy I am
to come here, Steve.

280
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,598
Papi.

281
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,634
Stevie, you home. How was your trip?

282
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,871
- Your plane safe?
- Save it. He knows.

283
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,553
Her English is getting good, right?

284
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,636
Uh....

285
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,956
Hey, sweetheart.

286
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,473
- Yeah.
- No, Papi, no!

287
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,960
No, Papi, no!

288
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,914
No!

289
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,080
No.

290
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,040
No!

291
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,352
You can buy baby food at the Food 4 Less,
sweetie.

292
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,070
They put artificial coloring
and preservatives in that crap.

293
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,234
Yeah, but the carrots gave him gas.

294
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,319
No, that was the peas and eggplant,
won't do that again.

295
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,431
It's okay. It's okay.

296
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,829
Hello.

297
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,199
<i>- You have a collect call from--</i>
- Collect? Yes. Yes.

298
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,875
- Karen? Sweetie?
- Karen?

299
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,560
Is she okay?

300
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,677
Sheils, honey. It's Frank.

301
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,916
Frank who?

302
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,070
"Frank" Frank.

303
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,393
Uh-- Uh-- Listen, Sheils, here's the situation.

304
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,271
I'm out of the country on business
and it's the craziest thing...

305
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,512
...someone stole all my money
and my passport.

306
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,558
Shit! Shit!

307
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,360
Hey, hey. Trouble, <i>señor?</i>

308
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,556
What?

309
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,076
Maybe I can help.

310
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,154
Here he comes.

311
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,589
Yo, man, I want to talk to somebody!

312
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,158
- You been up to see Mickey?
- No.

313
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,031
I sent him some girl-on-girl porn last week,
it's the only thing he ever wants.

314
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,360
- Hey.
- Hey.

315
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,512
Thanks, man. How you doing?

316
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,200
Hey.

317
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,351
- Ow! What the fuck?
- Asshole.

318
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,119
What the hell was that about?

319
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,954
Wasn't too happy to hear
about you getting caught.

320
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,156
How'd it go?

321
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,519
Public defender thinks I can get off with
community service if we take the laser back.

322
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,151
Underprivileged kid trying to gain access
to equipment he doesn't have...

323
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,556
...at his ghetto ass underfunded
high school.

324
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,394
- Heh, heh.
- Hey, thanks for bailing me out.

325
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,837
All Mandy, she used her dad's line of credit
at Bad Bob's Bonds.

326
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,191
Miss a hearing,
my dad will come after you...

327
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,797
...with a linoleum knife
and a bucket of battery acid.

328
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,195
Hey.

329
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,318
- You knew about this?
- Absolutely not.

330
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,871
I'm shocked and humiliated
by this betrayal, I can't believe it.

331
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,512
How could she be unfaithful to me
after everything we've been through?

332
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,710
Better safe than sorry.

333
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,199
Well, looks like you guys don't need me
around here anymore.

334
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,431
Put some gloves on.

335
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,754
You get to hold his foot while I cut.

336
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,035
Fiona.

337
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,354
Burrito?

338
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,319
I warmed it on the septic truck engine.
Works great.

339
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,278
Uh-- No, thanks.

340
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,556
So my lazy-ass nephew,
my brother Howie's kid with the big head?

341
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,189
- You remember him from school?
- Howie, Jr., sure.

342
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,114
Anyway, he's back from college
for the summer--

343
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,634
Howie, Jr.'s in college?

344
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,154
Wrestling scholarship.

345
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,835
Majoring in beer pong and date rape
from what I hear.

346
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,319
Anyways, he's back for the summer
and he needs a job.

347
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,991
You're a hard worker, but blood is blood.

348
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,710
When's Jr. back?

349
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,036
That's it?

350
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,035
I'll call you if anything big comes up
and we need some extra hands.

351
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,875
We're almost done here. Now get
your wife dressed and go have a nice dinner.

352
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,914
Huh? Someplace expensive.

353
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,191
I'll come join you later.

354
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,477
I only have one shoe.

355
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,873
Take a pair of Marco's,
he always had good taste in footwear.

356
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,872
No. Toss it with the rest.

357
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,038
It was stupid. I've spent too many
Saturdays stuck on a bus...

358
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,954
...going downstate to get felt up
by dyke prison guards.

359
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,670
No school science project
is worth going to jail for.

360
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,071
- Not for school.
- What, were you gonna pawn it?

361
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,999
- Nope.
- Sell it on eBay?

362
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,316
No.

363
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,473
Gonna teach some arrogant college
wapanese assholes...

364
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,235
...not to fuck with the South Side.

365
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,995
- Sure you are.
- What the fuck?

366
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,157
You know, a fast-moving current
can knock a grown man off his feet.

367
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,720
Did you see <i>Anaconda?</i>

368
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,072
Hey. Shh. Just keep moving, all right?

369
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,912
That was Central America. Okay, I'm going.

370
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,392
- That's not how lasers work.
- Yes, they do.

371
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,000
No, they don't.

372
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,436
What's that?

373
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,672
It's a miniature Mars Rover,
mounting a helium-neon laser on it.

374
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,277
- We're gonna blow shit up with it.
- Hey, language.

375
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,912
Hey, final notice on the property tax,
you going down there tomorrow?

376
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,720
- Later.
- Where are you going?

377
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,950
Study group.

378
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,357
- No dinner?
- No Jimmy.

379
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,150
- No cookies after school either.
- He wasn't here when you came home?

380
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,630
No and his Beemer's still out front.

381
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,877
Want me to open a can of tuna?

382
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,033
- Sure.
- You wanna get that one for me?

383
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,792
- Whiskey, I need whiskey.
- Shh.

384
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,032
- We have to stay hydrated.
- The sun's almost down, it's not hot.

385
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,110
How much further?

386
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,239
Twenty miles to the rendezvous.

387
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,553
- How far have we gone so far?
- Two.

388
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,870
Can we stop for a second,
I'm getting a blister.

389
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,913
No, seriously, I'm wearing the wrong
shoes, anybody have a Band-Aid?

390
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,032
Shit.

391
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,356
Jesus.

392
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,037
Okay. Okay.

393
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,760
American. American.

394
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,599
I'm an American. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

395
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,077
Did you check the hospitals today?

396
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,038
No Frank.

397
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,113
Okay, Deb.

398
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,555
Come on, time for bed.

399
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,279
He'll come back, Debs.

400
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,033
Frank's like scabies.

401
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,398
You can't get rid of him
no matter how hard you try.

402
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,599
Bedtime.

403
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,720
Ian?

404
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,040
Mandy.

405
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,352
Yeah, her dad's mixing vodka
and speedballs again, so....

406
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,839
You being smart?

407
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,117
- Lost my job today.
- What, you fucking the boss?

408
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,194
No, nepotism. Nephew.

409
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,473
Hey, uh....

410
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,111
We gonna have enough
for the property tax bill?

411
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,315
Just. With the check I got today.

412
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,799
Where you been?

413
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,119
- I just ran into a friend. Grabbed dinner.
- Oh.

414
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,839
- What are you doing?
- I was burning my clothes.

415
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,638
- Why?
- You don't need to know.

416
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,479
- I don't?
- Nope.

417
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,837
Take a shower.

418
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,759
Scrub my back?

419
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,835
You want me to scrub your back?

420
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,356
No, no. Use Euler's.

421
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,034
- Where? Here?
- Come on.

422
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,716
- Cosine X.
- Oh.

423
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,392
Yeah.

424
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,394
Hey. Catch.

425
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,912
Open it.

426
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,760
- What is it?
- GPS wrist unit.

427
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,310
For your ROTC orienting weekends.

428
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,874
So you know where you are.

429
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,760
We're supposed to learn that
off of maps and stuff.

430
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,276
Come on. They teaching you
how to use a sextant?

431
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,231
Modern infantry officers have, like,
a grand worth of satellite gear in their pack.

432
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,438
We need to learn how
in case we get separated from our unit...

433
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,832
...or all that fancy equipment
breaks down in a harsh environment.

434
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,193
Oh, come on.

435
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,353
Just take it.

436
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,799
I sort of have a boyfriend.

437
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,392
Well, I sort of have a wife.

438
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,160
He's been gone for a while
but he's gonna be back in a couple weeks.

439
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,839
Young or old?

440
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,195
- Young.
- Ah.

441
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,515
You up for a threesome? Hm?

442
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:01,277
- I mean, an old guy can dream, can't he?
- Ha, ha, ha.

443
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,794
Keep dreaming.

444
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,755
Come here.

445
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,518
- Who needs more eggs?
- Me, please.

446
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,399
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

447
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,349
- You came in late for a school night.
- Trig test in a couple weeks, you know.

448
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,391
- Couldn't find your pants?
- Stop making a mess.

449
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,155
I made them lunches.
What time you have to be at work?

450
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,357
- Laid off.
- Stop it.

451
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,758
- That's all right. You hated that job.
- Didn't hate the money.

452
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,994
- Time to get in bed when the kids leave?
- I wish. I can't, I have a meeting.

453
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,039
Bus is leaving, dishes in the sink.
Mandy, you need a ride?

454
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,634
- If you got room.
- All right.

455
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,599
- Meeting with who?
- Old friend from last night.

456
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,480
- Old friend have a name?
- Arnando. Used to work together.

457
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,360
- He came unexpectedly.
- Used to work together doing what?

458
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,429
Butcher shop.

459
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,434
- Debbie, milk in the fridge. All right!
- We're coming.

460
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,432
Train's leaving! Mandy!

461
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,591
Get in the back. Are you guys ready?

462
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,598
You good? You good?

463
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,638
Hey, just, uh....

464
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,520
I'll be back. Just don't make the bed.

465
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,512
Let's go, Jimmy!

466
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,720
What now?

467
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,280
Now you go away.

468
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,636
What? That's it?
You're just gonna give up?

469
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,757
Hey, I'm thirsty.

470
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,832
- You a quitter, Manuel?
- What?

471
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,117
A quitter? A little baby quitter?

472
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,039
- I'll give you a thousand dollars.
- You promised me five!

473
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,197
That or let me cut out a kidney to sell.

474
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,718
Well, that was before I realized
that you were a little pansy quitter.

475
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,957
Now, that is the spirit
I've been looking for.

476
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,430
But let's channel it
into something constructive.

477
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,638
Like getting me on
the other side of the Rio Grande.

478
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,634
How bad do you want to get back?

479
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,470
- It's "badly," but yes, bad.
- Come, amigo.

480
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,070
Let me introduce you
to my friend, El Cuchillo.

481
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,799
- El Cuchillo?
- Yeah.

482
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,314
- Cuchillo.
- Let's go.

483
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,910
Cuchillo. "The knife"?

484
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,640
Your sister doesn't like me.

485
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,440
No, she's just worried
I'm gonna knock you up.

486
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,831
Doesn't want any more
Gallagher mouths to feed.

487
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,595
I'm not my mom, 13 with my brother
on her hip.

488
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,515
- Thirteen, huh?
- Twelve when she got pregnant.

489
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,959
What the hell is that?

490
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,589
This? This is a helium-neon laser.

491
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,878
I'm gonna perform Lasix
on near-sighted neighborhood kids.

492
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,838
Fifty bucks a pop.

493
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,793
What are you doing this summer?

494
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,031
Probably pretty much
what I did last summer.

495
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,352
Drink too much beer,
smoke a lot of weed.

496
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,233
Yeah, well, that ain't gonna work.

497
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,911
You're gonna pad your résumé
for your college apps this summer.

498
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,992
You're a poor kid from the South Side.

499
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,360
And you got a 4.6 and that's great,
but you're gonna need a full ride.

500
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,234
- What's so goddamn funny?
- No, it's just, um....

501
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,080
Why does everyone think
I'm going to college?

502
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,319
Dummy. You're going to college.
And you're gonna graduate.

503
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,870
And then get your masters
and your doctorate.

504
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,396
Then you're gonna make
a boatload of money.

505
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,957
Spend the summer padding this résumé.

506
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,915
Uh....

507
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,232
Doing what?

508
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,114
I don't give a shit.

509
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,631
Teach brain-damaged kids
how to make plastic explosives...

510
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,632
...or the blind how to blow glass.

511
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,917
You know, I already have my sights set...

512
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,390
...on a few hundred hours
of community service.

513
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,272
Okay.

514
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,670
That's good.

515
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,999
Get it done.

Juvenile Court System.

517
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,310
You got a 4.6?

518
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,996
My GPA is, like, 1.2.

519
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,712
How smart are you?

520
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,479
You find anything?

521
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,919
- Nothing I can get with a GED.
- Go to Malcolm X. Take some Nurse classes.

522
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,993
You got Jimmy playing Mr. Mom,
take advantage of it.

523
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,556
- This Aunt Jemima scarf too much?
- You topless?

524
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,598
- Yeah.
- No one's looking at your head.

525
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,672
- How much does college cost?
- Nothing.

526
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:03,232
Take out a shitload of student loans, then
bail on the feds once you get your degree.

527
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,394
Bookkeeping, accounting,
x-ray technician, dental hygienist--

528
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,552
Ech! I get grossed out just flossing my teeth.

529
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,831
I've been shoveling sewage
the last month.

530
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,232
Computer programming.
Drug and alcohol rehab counselor.

531
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,551
Have the practical experience for that one.

532
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,997
Crap, you need a bunch of psych
pre-requisites first.

533
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,720
Take the civil service exam,
get on the ITC.

534
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,476
- Drive a bus?
- Pension, health care, paid vacations.

535
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,155
- Or there's the post office.
- Uniforms are for shit.

536
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,875
Everyone looks like they have
a dick in those pants.

537
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,750
Wow. Lot of people queuing up online for this.
This might just work.

538
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,389
Club's gonna open up
the outdoor patio soon.

539
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,951
Maybe Meg would give me a shot
at managing, or at least my old job.

540
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,194
Slinging Appletinis? Didn't need to get
your GED to shake your tits for frat boys.

541
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,080
The money's good
and it doesn't require pre-requisites.

542
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,152
Requires a couple. Set up the camera.

543
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,392
- We're ready to go.
- Who are you supposed to be?

544
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,755
Thomas Jefferson.

545
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,914
Okay, Miss Sally, get your revenge
for me raping you in the slave quarters.

546
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:07,040
- Massa.
- Ah! Ooh.

547
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,077
Get down, you white motherfucker.
Get in there. Oh!

548
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,000
Now get that ass.
Munch it, munch it.

549
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,270
Do the alphabet.

550
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,955
We shall overcome, motherfucker.
Get in there.

551
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,756
We shall overcome. Ah! Unh!

552
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,790
Get on.

553
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,631
Hey, Meg. How are you?

554
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,718
Fiona. Gallagher.

555
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,394
Sure, how you been?

556
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,318
Thought I'd stop by,
see if you were staffing up for summer yet.

557
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,472
Patio's not open until Memorial Day.

558
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,235
But if you want to push cocktails
in six-inch heels...

559
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,438
...I can always use another pretty girl
for the summer.

560
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,399
I was hoping you'd give me a shot
at assistant managing...

561
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,074
...like we discussed last fall.

562
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,758
- Congrats.
- Yeah.

563
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,956
I know I screwed you over last time.
It's a family thing, my mother was--

564
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,112
I get it, you have it tough.

565
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,432
But fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice....

566
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,359
I won't let you down again.

567
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,076
Come on, give me one night to show you
what I can do. You won't regret it.

568
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,271
Give me a thousand bucks,
I'll find you a night to promote.

569
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,835
- Promote?
- Yeah, you take over the club, do it all.

570
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,754
- How about Tuesday the 15th?
- Next week?

571
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,593
Show me what you got.

572
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,515
- I don't have a thousand dollars.
- So I'll pencil you in to work the patio.

573
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,639
Give me a call mid-May
and keep the weight off.

574
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,591
- Mimosa?
- Sure.

575
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,673
A man has few things
of real value in this life.

576
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,670
His family.

577
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,352
His friends.

578
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,315
His ability to honor his commitment.
The value of his word.

579
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,118
Eat, please.

580
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,074
I believe the only true measure of a man...

581
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,757
...is his willingness to accept responsibility
for his action.

582
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,758
Don't you agree?

583
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,833
We're here.

584
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,157
Beautiful, very peaceful.

585
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,152
The Great Lakes, right?

586
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,315
Lake Michigan.

587
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,234
- How many Great Lakes are there?
- Uh....

588
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,675
Five?

589
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:27,517
I knew the Great Lakes were big,
but I never imagined it would be this big.

590
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,393
Just like a sea.

591
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,400
Surprisingly heavy for a man
with so few brains.

592
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,078
So Steve...

593
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,638
...are you a man capable
of honoring your commitments?

594
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,716
Are you a man of your word?

595
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,950
Cuchillo

596
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,870
So you are an American, huh?

597
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,799
- Yeah.
- Wanting to go home...

598
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,912
...but you have no papers?

599
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,800
No. See. We were sort of partying--

600
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,636
- Say, "Ah."
- Ah. Ah, ah, ah.

601
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,434
Good?

602
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,631
Whoa! No, amigo, I'm not that kind of girl, I--

603
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,235
Jesus--! Okay. Okay, fellas...

604
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,710
...I'm really kind of
getting skeeved out here.

605
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,277
- Can I--? Can I take--?
- Good luck, <i>putita.</i>

606
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,750
What happened to paying you
when you do the work?

607
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,196
It was her way of telling me
to go fuck myself.

608
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,354
What pissed me off was how she assumed
that I couldn't come up with the money.

609
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,513
- Smug bitch.
- We did all right on that master-slave thing.

610
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,036
- I could loan you the money--
- No. It's okay.

611
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,796
I love you, but you gotta save up
for when you have a baby.

612
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,834
What about Jimmy?

613
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,036
He's being weird.

614
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,271
Meg's right. I am a loser.

615
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,750
One more ghetto girl
who thinks she's the shit.

616
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,197
- I can't manage a club.
- What's that, self-pity?

617
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,555
No, reality.

618
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,555
I'll take the Civil Service exam,
clean bus shelter trash barrels for the city.

619
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,949
Hey!

620
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,520
You're Fiona Gallagher.

621
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,672
You can do anything
you set your mind to.

622
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,959
You got your GED. You been raising
a family of six since you were 15 years old.

623
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,119
You're a rock star
and Meg's a frigid bitch.

624
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,436
What's that?

625
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,319
My final paycheck.

626
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,393
<i>Looks like this battle is almost over!</i>

627
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,438
<i>The Red Robotron is in trouble!</i>

628
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,074
<i>Scorpio 5 for the win!</i>

629
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,917
Back for yet another round
of ritual humiliation, Gallagher?

630
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,753
Finally gonna win this time, Goff.

631
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,833
College entrants only today,
it was on the website.

632
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,232
Or don't you have internet
down at MLK Charter?

633
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,120
Afraid a teenager is gonna kick the shit...

634
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,035
- ...out of your half-assed bucket of bolts?
- Heh, heh. Your engineering can't compete...

635
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,159
...at the Black Bot Championship
Trophy level, Gallagher.

636
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,391
Who'd you steal your designs from
this time?

637
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,280
Was it Carnegie Mellon or MIT?

638
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,952
Entry fee is 150,
and we don't take food stamps.

639
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:01,193
<i>Next match: Scorpio 5 versus the Impaler!</i>

640
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,038
<i>Let the battle begin!</i>

641
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,754
<i>Oh, the Impaler strikes!</i>

642
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,714
<i>Scorpio 5 down!</i>

643
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,953
Piece of cake.

644
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,238
Whoa, whoa.
How am I supposed to swallow that?

645
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,153
Who said anything about swallowing?

646
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,513
She's always been a problem.

647
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:16,230
It's been a relief to have her
out of the house these last months.

648
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,790
She was wrecking my marriage. Pull!

649
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,270
- You lied to me, Steve.
- Yes, but I thought--

650
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,995
You told me you were
going to look after her. Pull!

651
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,317
I'm sure it's been difficult.
She's a bright girl.

652
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,800
But I spoiled her.

653
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,039
I grew up poor, you know.

654
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:42,076
I wanted her to have things I didn't have
at the favela. An education, food.

655
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,274
A toilet. Pull!

656
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,433
I've arranged for Estefania
to pursue an economics degree...

657
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,478
...here at the University of Chicago.

658
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,000
I want her to be
an American citizen, Steve.

659
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,511
When Immigration comes...

660
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,558
...you will be her husband. Pull!

661
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,199
You think you can do that for me, Steve?

662
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,473
Can I trust you?

663
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,710
Absolutely.

664
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,079
But that means you can't get
into any trouble.

665
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,709
No stolen cars, no drugs.

666
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,597
How am I supposed to make a living?

667
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,320
Get a job.

668
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,477
And the slum girl-- Fiona, yes?

669
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,839
You can fuck her all you want for fun.

670
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,198
But you're a married man now.
She stays what she is.

671
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,392
A ghetto whore.

672
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:05,832
<i>In this corner, the Terror
of Northwestern U, Rent-A-Raptor!</i>

673
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,238
<i>And in this corner,
representing the South Side...</i>

674
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,995
<i>...Frank!</i>

675
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,111
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
let's get ready to rum-bot!</i>

676
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,279
Next.

677
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,836
- Go ahead. Step up, please.
- Thank you.

678
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,390
- Passport.
<i>- Let's battle!</i>

679
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,229
<i>Ooh! Frank is in trouble early.</i>

680
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,718
- Fry the fucker, come on.
<i>- Oh, Frank gets away!</i>

681
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,670
- Get out of there!
- What are you doing?

682
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,194
<i>Frank is loose!</i>

683
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,837
<i>Rent-A-Raptor!</i>

684
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,549
- Go, go, go!
- Wait, wait.

685
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,798
<i>Frank is on the run!</i>

686
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,680
<i>Oh, looks like Frank
is down for the count.</i>

687
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,197
- Get out of the way!
- Get out, go! Go!

688
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,990
- I got it.
<i>- Rent-A-Raptor coming for the kill.</i>

689
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,637
<i>It won't be long now.</i>

690
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,353
<i>He did it! He did it!</i>

691
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,474
<i>We have a new champion!</i>

692
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,640
Welcome home, Mr. Duncan.

693
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,752
Jack.

694
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,839
Jack!

695
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,671
Just keep walking.

696
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,150
- No trouble?
- They just waived me right through.

697
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,119
<i>El Gran Cañon</i> in person.

698
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,671
<i>El Gran Cañon</i>, your new nickname.
You're already a legend.

699
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,112
Eighteen balloons? We've never had
more than eight up one ass.

700
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,638
You have more coke up your anus
than any drug mule in cartel history.

701
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,271
It's like taking a shit backwards. Heh, heh.

702
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:20,119
Ex-Lax. Normally, I would say take two,
but for you, maybe the whole box.

703
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:31,594
So you're just gonna play the same playlist
that you did last night. Awesome.

704
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,399
Tuesday the 15th?

705
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,398
A thousand dollars, it's all there.

706
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,391
No, I'm sure it is. But, you know, look...

707
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,632
...promoting a new night is difficult.
I should have explained--

708
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,753
- I want the club.
- You've got a bunch of kids at home.

709
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,357
- I don't think you should--
- Do I have the club or not?

710
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,155
Okay. You're on the calendar.

711
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,518
Hey, beautiful! Dinner's almost ready.

712
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,071
Jesus, Jimmy, you always
gotta monitor Carl when he's online.

713
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,675
Okay, sure.

714
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,274
I'm sorry.

715
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,633
- What the hell were you watching?
- History Channel.

716
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,116
- Dinner!
- Where were you all day?

717
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,749
Just, you know, running errands.

718
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,434
This and that. How was your day?

719
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,832
Remember Meg? She's gonna give me
my own night to promote.

720
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,719
That's great.

721
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,071
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

722
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,954
- You won?
- Oh, yeah.

723
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,954
Nothing left but smoking metal
and bruised geek egos.

724
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,830
Yeah, plus 400 bucks cash prize
for first place.

725
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,754
Help out a little bit
with the property tax bill.

726
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:54,391
You want me to run the payment
down to the post office before school?

727
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,313
No, I got it.

728
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,671
That's still daddy's spot.

729
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,799
- Anything at the hospitals?
- I forgot to check today, Debs.

730
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,879
- I'll call after dinner, okay?
- Here we go, dinner's served.

731
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,635
- Oh, what's that?
- Can we make way over here?

732
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,553
Thank you, Billy!

733
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,630
Yeah, you saw. It's like a miniature--

734
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,074
Robot Wars?

735
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,477
Some of that. All right, so, Robot War.

736
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:01,391
It's like cage fighting.
Like, octagon rings and....

737
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,592
Daddy.

738
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,398
Daddy!

739
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,116
And it's like a laser?

740
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,350
Nineteen.

741
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,396
Thank you, Sheila.
